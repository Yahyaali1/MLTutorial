Bayes Theorem 
	-Basic Assumption that every feature in the data set is independent. 
	With an example of defective parts.
	P(A/B) = (P(B/A) * P(A) )/ P(B)
	P(Defective/Mach2) = (P(Mach2/Defective)*P(Defective))/P(Mach2)
	
	Example:
	Probability of a category/Given Features  = (Likelihood) * (Piror Probability)/
												(Marginal Likelihood)
											= P(Given Feature/Category) * P(Category)/
												P(Features)
	P(Marginal Likelihood) = Select Observation around new point
					- So in statement it is "what is the likelihood" of picking up 
						something that exhibits similar features as our new observation. 
					- Highly depends on the radius. 
					- 
	P(Likelihood) = Given that out of all the things belonging to certain category,
							 What is the probability that they will exhibit feature 
							 similar to the selected points under Likelihood 
	
	How to work with more then 2 features ? 
	What is P(X). Given that we add a new point in the dataset, what is the likelihood
	that it would fall under the area we have selected? 
	Note:
		Given we are comparing two categories, we can ignore calculation for P(X) as 
		it will be ignore anyway.
