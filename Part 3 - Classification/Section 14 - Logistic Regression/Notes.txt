Logistic Regression 
-For problems such as classification. 
-Example is a yes & no Question. 
-Doesn't fit a linear model because it doesn't make sense 
-It is more relevant if we can use probability to predict the result
-Apply logistic regression function to linear function to achieve the final result
-Basically, we are trying to find a line that best fits the data. And in this case
-Logistic function fits best to a data that has yes/no answer.
- A certain probability can be defined as well to classify the predicted value if it 
- is a yes or no. For example if p >0.5 then it is yes otherwise it would be no
