R2 intuition 
- Formula for R^2 = 1 - (Sum of squared error for each value from each origional value)/(Sum of square distance from mean value)
if the values of R^2 is greater means it is better. since the R residuals is small

Problem with R^2. 
- If we increase the number of variables. The value of r square will increase
