R2 intuition 
- Formula for R^2 = 1 - (Sum of squared error for each value from each origional value)/(Sum of square distance from mean value)
if the values of R^2 is greater means it is better. since the R residuals is small

Problem with R^2. 
- If we increase the number of variables. The value of r square will always increase. As there would always be some co releation between
  variables

Adjusted R square 

R^2 = 1 - (1-R^2) * n-1 / n-p-1. n = sample size. p is the number of regressor. 
This will increase if there is some positive impact of the variable otherwise penalized. 
For variables to have significant impact R^2 needs to increase significantly.
